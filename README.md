# MONSERRATE Corpus

MONSERRATE is a dataset specifically built to automatically evaluate Question Generation systems, with, on average, 26 questions associated to each source sentence, attempting to be an "exhaustive" reference.

---

Despite the growing interest in Question Generation, evaluating these systems remains notably difficult. Many authors rely on metrics like BLEU or ROUGE instead of relying on manual evaluations, as their computation is mostly free. However, corpora generally used as reference is very incomplete, containing just a couple of hypotheses per source sentence.
